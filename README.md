Project: Rusty_PresentParsing and Data Analysis

This project is an implementation of a parser for the PresentMon application. It will provide detailed results from the data collected with the PresentMon application

There are some existing parsers for the data that is generated with the PresentMon program but they are either not kept up anymore or don't analyze and present the data in ways that are completley useful to me. This is also meant to be an exercise in learning Rust in depth.

Planned functions: (CLI)
  1. Parse the CSV file generated by PresentMon
  2. Calculate the following  
    - Avg. FPS  
    - Avg. Frametimes  
    - Median FPS  
    - Median Frametime  
    - 1%/99% Low FPS exact and average  
    - 3%/97% Low FPS exact and average  
    - Number of Dropped Frames  
    - Frames below threshold values i.e. 30, 60, 144, 240 FPS  
    - Detect number of frametime spikes that would be visible stutter\lag

This program will operate on the command line. It will take a file to work on as an argument and generate and display the results on the command line and also output the results to a log file.  

Stretch functions: (No specific order)
  - Work on multiple datasets in a given directory to combine results i.e. n runs of a game gives one set of results after processing  
  - Parse CSV file generated by other programs that may be used simultaneuosly while gathering data i.e. HWiNFO  
  - Setup and start PresentMon and other programs and sync their data collection  
  - Move from CLI to GUI  
  - Generate new CSV or datafile that is easily consumed by other programs to generate graphs/charts
