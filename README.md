# Rusty_PresentParsing
This project is an implementation of a parser for the PresentMon application. It will provide detailed results from the data collected with the PresentMon application

There are some existing parsers for the data that is generated with the PresentMon program but they are either not kept up anymore or don't analyze and present the data in ways that are completley useful to me. This is also meant to be an exercise in learning Rust in depth.

Planned functions: (CLI)
  1. Parse the CSV file generated by PresentMon
  2. Calculate the following
    - Avg. FPS
    - Avg. Frametimes
    - Median FPS
    - Median Frametime
    - 1%/99% Low FPS exact and average
    - 3%/97% Low FPS exact and average
    - Number of Dropped Frames
    - Frames below threshold values i.e. 30, 60, 144, 240 FPS
    - Detect number of frametime spikes that would be visible stutter\lag

Stretch functions:
  1. Parse CSV file generated by other programs that may be used simultaneuosly while gathering data i.e. HWiNFO
  2. Setup and start PresentMon and other programs and sync their data collection
  3. Move from CLI to GUI
